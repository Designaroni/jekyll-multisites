# jekyll-multisites

Jekyll Multisites allows granular control over sharing codebases, plugins, files &amp; assets across multiple Jekyll builds.

### Purpose

The purpose of `jekyll-multisites` is to demonstrate the capabilities of Jekyll as a tool for sharing assets across multiple builds. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, image assets, plugins & gems can be shared as the source files for ia system of websites.   

### Usage

To spin up the example sites first download the git repository: `$ git clone git@github.com:Designaroni/jekyll-multisites.git`

#### Running the sites individually


To build & serve either site run one of the following commands from the repository

```
$ bundle exec jekyll serve --config _config_site_one.yml
$ bundle exec jekyll serve --config _config_site_two.yml
```

### Inspiration

Inspiration for this project came out of a need to share modular web components across a system of sites, Branding assets, shared call to action banners, modules of custom html, css & javscript & shared vendor assets.
